Data Detectives: Decoding Crime Patterns with Predictive Analytics
Overview
This repository hosts the Data Detectives' project focused on using predictive analytics to decode crime patterns. Our aim is to provide real-time insights into crime likelihoods in specific areas, enhancing community safety.

Problem Statement
The project addresses the global rise in crime and the information gap that leaves citizens uninformed and vulnerable. Our solution is a predictive model forecasting specific crimes in designated locations.

Dataset
Los Angeles City, California: The primary focus area.
Data Sources: LAPD Crime Data, Visual Crossing Weather Data.
Variables: Crime incidents, victim details, location, climate factors.
Methodology
Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and analysis using various predictive models.
Decision tree, random forest, ANN, XGBoost, and LASSO methods evaluated for performance.
Key Findings
Performance metrics of different models.
Insights from data exploration and model evaluation.
Conclusions and Future Work
Effectiveness of predictive modeling in crime anticipation.
Recommendations for further refinement and model tuning.
